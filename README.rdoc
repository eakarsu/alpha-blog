This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:



To set root route to pages controller home:

Navigate to config/routes.rb file and enter in the following code ->

root 'pages#home'

The reference to the root path within the application code would be root_path

Git references:

git-scm.com

git-scm.com/book/en/v2

gitref.org

First time (required only once to configure git for your environment):

git config --global user.name "Your name"

git config --global user.email "Your email"

replace Your name and Your email above with your actual name and email address which you want shown on repo

To display git config settings:

git config --list

Some useful git commands:

To initialize a git repository for your application (do this from within the application directory) ->

git init

To add/track all files ->

git add -A

To commit changes/updates/additions to repository ->

git commit -m "A useful message to help remember details of commit"

To check current state of file updates with already committed code in repo ->

git status

To reject latest changes ->

git checkout -f

Site to create free online code repositories:

github.com

bitbucket.org



Pushing to hithub:



To display your public SSH key:

cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

When creating github repo for application ensure you click the SSH button then push existing repo:

git remote add origin git@github.com:yourgithubaccountname/alpha-blog.git

git push -u origin master # Remember you only need to use this command the first time

To view remotes setup in your environment (from your app directory):

git remote -v

For future pushes to repository:

git push

To deploy app to production, we'll use heroku in this course, link to heroku:

www.heroku.com

Deploying to heroku:



Prepartion for heroku deploy:

- Remove sqlite3 gem from top of application to within group :development, :test do block

- Create a group production ->

group :production do

gem 'pg'

gem 'rails_12factor'

end

- Save Gemfile

- Run bundle install --without production to update Gemfile.lock file

- Commit your changes to git repo ->

git add -A

git commit -m "Make app production ready"

Command to install heroku toolbelt to your nitrous environment:

wget -qO- https://toolbelt.heroku.com/install-ubuntu.sh | sh

Check heroku:

heroku -v

heroku version

heroku # for list of common heroku commands

From your app directory:

To login to your heroku account from your nitrous env ->

heroku login

To add your SSH key to your heroku account so you don't have to use username and password everytime ->

heroku keys:add

To create a new production version of your app hosted in heroku ->

heroku create

To push your application code to heroku (deploy your app) ->

git push heroku master

Ensure you have committed all your local changes to your git repo prior to pushing to heroku by checking git status

To change the name of your application ->

heroku rename newnameofyourapp

replace newnameofyourapp above with the name you'd like to give your app

Your app will then be accessible from the following browser URL ->

newnameofyourapp.herokuapp.com

CRUD operations:


Query language to communicate with database: SQL (Structured Query Language)

CRUD actions:

C - Create

R - Read

U - Update

D - Delete

Scaffold generator command to create Article model, articles controller, views for articles and migration file to create articles table:

rails generate scaffold Article title:string description:text

Command to see routes present for your app:

rake routes

The line resources :articles in the config/routes.rb file provides the following routes:

- index of articles (listing)

- new article

- create article

- edit article

- update article (put and patch)

- show article

- delete article

From UI perspective ->

- index lists all the articles in the db of the app

- new article deals with the form to enter in new article details

- create handles the submission of the items in the new article form

- edit article deals with the form to enter in edit details for an existing article

- update article deals with the submission of the edited details

- show article displays an individual article based on selection

- delete article deletes an article from the db
